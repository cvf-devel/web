<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Overview</span>
<br>
The CVPR Doctoral Consortium will provide a unique opportunity to students who are close to finishing, or who have very recently finished, their doctorate degree, to interact with renowned and experienced researchers in the field, and discuss with them their ongoing research and career plans. One senior member of the community will be assigned as mentor for each student based on similarity of research interests. At the meeting, each student will present a poster either overviewing his or her thesis research or a single recent paper, which will be discussed with the mentors and other participants.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Details</span>
<br>
The CVPR 2013 Doctoral Consortium will take place on Tuesday, June 25th, from 12:00-1:30pm (in Exhibit Hall A1).

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Eligibility</span>
<br>
All Ph.D. students in computer vision who will graduate within the next 6 months, as well as those who have graduated in the past 6 months are eligible.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Submission Guidelines</span>
<br>
Eligible students who would like to participate in the Doctoral Consortium and receive a travel grant should send an application to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01nadmrzF7gzLOky3H_yI6fQ==&c=evQZGHAI__DHBw81yc-pAqdeRS4IzSLCEBBEqMJfJss=" target="_blank">Philippos Mordohai</a> including the following. Items 1-3 should be combined into a single pdf file.
<ol>
<li>a two-page cover letter summarizing the applicant's research and progress to date and also proposing names of potential mentors,</li>
<li>a CV including the expected graduation date,</li>
<li>the title and author list of the poster that will be presented at the consortium, which may or may not be presented at CVPR as well,</li>
<li>a note from their advisor confirming the date of graduation and stating his/her availability to participate as a mentor.</li>
</ol>
<br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Review Process</span>
<br>
If all applications cannot be supported, selection will be based on the above material and the student's graduation date. Priority will be given to students whose advisors commit to serving as volunteer mentors at the consortium. Institutional representation will be taken into account; it is unlikely that more than two students from the same institution will be invited.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Travel Awards</span>
<br>
Airfare and registration fees for CVPR will be covered for the selected students.
<br><br>
