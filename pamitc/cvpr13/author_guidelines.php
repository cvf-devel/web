<span class="cvprsectionheader">Submission Instructions</span>
<br><br>
Please refer to the following files for detailed formatting instructions.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Example submission paper with detailed instructions: <a target="_blank" href="files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (tar): <a href="files/cvpr2013AuthorKit.tgz">cvpr2013AuthorKit.tgz</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (zip): <a href="files/cvpr2013AuthorKit.zip">cvpr2013AuthorKit.zip</a></li>
</ul>
A complete paper should be submitted using the above templates, which are blind-submission review-formatted templates. The length should match that intended for final publication. Papers accepted for the conference will be allocated 6 pages in the proceedings, with the option of purchasing up to 2 extra pages for US$100 per page (to be paid after paper acceptance, at the time of registration for the conference). So, if you are unwilling or unable to pay the extra charge, you should limit yourself to 6 pages.  We know there are no printing charges, however the optional page charges help cover the cost of the reviewing process.  Papers with more than 8 pages (including references) will be rejected.

<br>
<span class="cvprsectionheader">Policies</span>
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Double blind review:</span> CVPR reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and area chairs/reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please read Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a> for  detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Dual/Double Submissions:</span> By submitting a manuscript to CVPR, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in an archival peer-reviewed forum. Furthermore, no paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper is neither under review at the moment of submission nor will be submitted during the CVPR 2013 review period to any of the following: another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The authors also attest that they did not submit substantially similar submissions to CVPR 2013. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection. If you are not sure about the extent of overlap, you may upload a copy of the paper in question as supplementary material. Note that a Technical Report (departmental, <a target="_blank" href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a>, etc.) that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is <b>NOT</b> considered a publication. Likewise, mention of the work under review in a presentation is <b>NOT</b> considered a violation.  For further information, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section_822F.html">Section 8.2.4.F</a> of the IEEE PSPB Operations Manual.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Conflict Responsibilities:</span>  It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that <b>all</b> authors on their paper have registered their conflicts into CMT. Conflicts are needed to resolve assignments to both reviewers and area chairs.   If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem, the paper may be summarily rejected.
<br><br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Author's Responsibilities:</span> If there are papers that may appear to violate any of these conditions, it is the authors' responsibility to (1) cite these papers (preserving anonymity as described in Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>), (2) argue in the body of your paper why your CVPR paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions, and (3) include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.
<br><br>




<br>
<span class="cvprsectionheader"><a name="SupplementaryMaterial"></a>Supplementary Material</span>
<br><br>
Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may not fit in the PDF size limit and may include:
<ul>
<li>videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system,</li>
<li>images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper,</li>
<li>anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals, and   </li>
<li>appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper.</li>
</ul>

CVPR encourages authors to submit videos using an MP4 codec such as DivX contained in an AVI. Also, please submit a README text file with each video specifying the exact codec used and a URL where the codec can be downloaded.
<br><br>
The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. Please note that:
<ol>
<li>All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. Alternatively, you can choose to upload a PDF file containing any non-video item listed above.  CMT imposes a 20MB limit on the size of this file. Note that you can update the file by uploading a new one (the old one will be deleted and replaced).</li>
<li>The paper for review (PDF only) must be submitted <b>first</b> before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be submitted.</li>
<li>Please make sure that the supplementary material directly supports the paper as submitted prior to the paper deadline. ONLY results generated by the algorithm/approach/system reported in the submitted version are allowed. Material based on improvements subsequent to the paper deadline is not allowed.</li>
<li><b>Do not submit a newer version of the paper as supplementary material.</b> A newer version of the paper or portion thereof, with description of an improved algorithm/approach/system or even one spelling or typo correction, is not allowed.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">If you have been invited to review for CVPR2013:</span><br>
If you have been invited to review for CVPR2013, an account has been automatically generated for you using the contact email as your account name (regardless of whether you agreed to review or not). You need to only request for a new password via "Reset your password". If you have agreed to review, please follow the reviewer login instructions.
<br>
<span class="cvprparagraphheader">If you have not been invited to review for CVPR2013:</span>
<br>
If you have not been invited to review for CVPR2013, you are not in the system. Please sign up as a new user. If you have generated an account and have forgotten your password, just click on "Reset your password". Instructions will be emailed to you.
<br>
<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">Logging in the first time:</span><br>
When you log in for the first time, you will be asked to enter your conflict domain information. You will not be able to submit any paper without entering this information. We need to ensure conflict-free reviewing of all papers.

<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">Update contact information:</span><br>
At any time, you can edit your contact information (see item near the top right in the submission site). Don't forget to click the "Update" button to save the edited information. If you wish to change the contact email address, you can modify it via the "Change your Email" box.

<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">Enter subject (topic) areas for your paper:</span><br>
When you submit a paper, you will be asked to specify its associated subject areas. Please note that you indicate only one "primary" subject area and any number of "secondary" subject areas. Please pay extra attention in selecting your subject areas, as this information is critical in allowing us to properly assign papers to area chairs and reviewers. Caution: you cannot pick the "primary" subject area as a "secondary" subject area; if you do this, the system will not allow you to save. For example, if you had picked "Face and Gesture" as the "primary" area, you cannot pick "Face and Gesture" as a "secondary" area.

<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">Paper Number</span><br>
Once you have registered your paper (i.e. title/authors), you will be assigned a paper number.  Insert this into the latex or word template before generating the pdf of your paper for submission.  Papers submitted without a number may not be reviewed.

<li><span class="cvprparagraphheader">Requirements:</span><br>
<ul>
<li>The maximum size of the abstract is 4000 characters.</li>
<li>The paper must be PDF only (maximum 20MB).</li>
<li>The supplementary material can be either PDF or ZIP only (maximum 30MB).</li>
<li>If your submission has co-authors, please make sure that you enter their email addresses that correspond exactly to their account names (assuming they have created accounts). This will ensure that your co-authors can see your submission when they log in. Co-authors must also have their conflict domains entered.</li>

<span class="cvprsectionheader">Author FAQs</span>
<br><br>
<span class="cvprparagraphheader">About Submitting Papers</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we please have an extension on the deadline?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> As stated in the on the Submission/Reviewing page under Reviewing Process / Workflow: "NO extensions will be given and any incomplete submission or a submission not meeting required criteria will be deleted".</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we get my quota increased for the size of paper submission from 20 MB to something higher?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> We have set hard limits of 20MB (PDF Only) for paper submission and 30MB (PDF or ZIP only) for supplementary materials for submissions for review. As we are expecting many submissions, and as each reviewer is expected to review (on average) about 10 papers, we feel that larger file downloads (and uploads) will tax the system and abilities of reviewers to get to the papers fast enough. Authors should consider adding hi-res images as supplementary material. See <a href="#SupplementaryMaterial">Supplementary Material</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">How do I delete Supplementary Material from the CMT site?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">We have added a feature that allows authors to remove supplementary files. After you log in, in the "Author" console, you'll notice "Upload/Delete File" at the end of the supplementary file name. Click on that, and in the page that appears, you can click on the "Delete" button to remove the supplementary file. (Please note that you will not be able to delete the supplementary file after the supplementary file deadline.)</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we submit color images with our papers for review?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES.</b> Reviewers will get the exact pdf file of the paper you submitted, so they can see the color images on the screen. Do be warned though that many reviews still like to read printed papers and not all have access to high-end color printers. Please make sure to comment in the paper to request the reviewers to see the color online copy.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">What is CVPR 2013 policy on DUAL SUBMISSIONS?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">Dual Submissions of <b>ANY</b> form to a peer-reviewed archival publication are grounds for immediate rejection.. By submitting a manuscript to CVPR, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published (or accepted for publication) in substantially similar form. Furthermore, no paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper either is under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the CVPR 2013 review period (November 15, 2011 - February 24, 2013) to any of the following: another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The authors also attest that they did not submit substantially similar submissions to CVPR 2013. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection. If you are not sure about the extent of overlap , you may upload a copy of the paper in question as supplementary material. For further information, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section_822F.html">Section 8.2.4.F</a> of the IEEE PSPB Manual.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a Technical Report (departmental, arXiv, etc.) with publication available online count as a prior publication and therefore ineligible to review and publication at IEEE CVPR 2013?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">A Technical Report that is put up without any form for direct peer-review is <b>NOT</b> considered a publication.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a presentation at a departmental seminar during the review period violate the anonymity standard or other CVPR 2013 policy?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> Authors must promise to not submit material under review to another publication and to properly anonymize the written submission per the guidelines. There is no requirement that the material otherwise be kept confidential during the review process.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">About Review Process</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Is the CVPR 2013 Review Process CONFIDENTIAL?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES,</b> CVPR 2013 Reviewing is considered confidential. All reviewers are required to keep every manuscript they review as confidential documents and not to share or distribute materials for any reason except to facilitate the reviewing of the submitted work. Reviewers are obligated to remove or destroy them after review. See the <a href="reviewer_guidelines.php">Reviewer Guidelines</a>. Accepted papers will be published (with appropriate copyrights) with a date of around June 25, 2013. Please make sure to discuss this issue with your legal advisors as it pertains to public disclosure of the contents of the papers submitted.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Are CVPR 2013 Reviews Double BLIND or Single BLIND?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">CVPR reviewing is <b>Double BLIND</b>, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and area chairs/reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please read Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>  for detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>


<span class="cvprparagraphheader">About Publications</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">As the CVPR 2013 Proceedings are Electronic/Digital, why do we need to pay for extra pages on acceptance of our paper that is longer then the default 6 pages? What are these funds used for?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">The default paper length for CVPR 2013 is 6 pages. If you submit an 8 page paper, you are increasing the work-load of the reviewers, and the cost of the reviewing and publication process. The extra page charges cover these additional costs (and effort) for our Area Chair reviewing.  This optional fee is considered a better alternative to increasing registration fees for everyone or charging a submission fee.  Added page fees are normally allowed on grants/contracts. </span></li>
