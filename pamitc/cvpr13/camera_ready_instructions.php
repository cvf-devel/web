An online author kit has been created that provides instructions regarding 
<ul>
<li>page limitations</li>
<li>paper formatting</li>
<li>paper and copyright deadlines</li>
<li>copyrights</li>
<li>reprints</li>
<li>paper submission - You will see notification regarding your successful paper transmission in the pop-up window. No additional e-mail confirmation will be mailed.</li>
</ul>
IEEE PDF eXpress is not a submission site. After reviewing your paper and checking for accuracy, authors must follow the submission instructions found at the author kit Web site. 
<br><br>
Use only the recommended fonts: Times, Times Roman, Times New Roman, and Helvetica. Be sure to embed and subset all fonts.
<br><br>
Note the following:
<ol>
<li>For users of non-Windows-based systems: We have tested the online submission process and we find that, in most instances,  authors who use a Windows-based system do receive notification of successful paper transmissions. Even if you do not receive a confirmation email you paper has been submitted. If you have further inquires please email <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01Ht0D3DQhTzFUzn_JeCNq7w==&amp;c=VCnTNTAPPhF3_bJYyi9_s9SvxXxIVHZb9Vgc24To3Pk=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501Ht0D3DQhTzFUzn_JeCNq7w\75\75\46c\75VCnTNTAPPhF3_bJYyi9_s9SvxXxIVHZb9Vgc24To3Pk\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">Patrick Kellenberger</a></li>
<li>Authors do not need to compose their documents using a Windows-based system.</li>
<li>We will check all papers and notify you if we find problems with your documents or if we have not received your work.</li>
<li>Please understand that, due to our full workload, we cannot acknowledge receipt of paper and copyright form. We will contact you only if problems arise.</li>
</ol>
