<br/><br/>
ICCV and PAMI-TC are happy to announce the availability of student travel grants for ICCV 2013 to be held in Sydney from Dec 1 to 8, 2013.<br/><br/>

Students wishing to apply for a travel grant should apply by completing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-Et7Evx_SDKal8xTHg2RDJYUXM/edit?usp=drive_web">application form</a> and submitting it following the instructions on the form.<br/><br/>

The amount of the grant will depend on the number of successful applicants, but is <i>not</i> expected to cover the complete costs of travel and accommodation.<br/><br/>

Applicants should have a paper accepted at the conference.<br/><br/>
