Brian Schmidt is a Laureate Fellow at The Australian National University's 
Mount Stromlo Observatory. Brian was raised in Montana and Alaska, USA, 
and received undergraduate degrees in Physics and Astronomy from the 
University of Arizona in 1989. Under the supervision of Robert Kirshner, he 
completed his Astronomy Master's degree (1992) and PhD (1993) from Harvard 
University. In 1994 he and Nick Suntzeff formed the High­Z SN Search team, 
a group of 20 astronomers on 5 continents who used distant exploding stars 
to trace the expansion of the Universe back in time. This group's discovery of 
an accelerating Universe was named Science Magazine's Breakthrough of the 
Year for 1998. Brian Schmidt joined the staff of the Australian National 
University in 1995, and was awarded the Australian Government's 
inaugural Malcolm McIntosh award for achievement in the Physical Sciences 
in 2000, The Australian Academy of Sciences Pawsey Medal in 2001, the 
Astronomical Society of India's Vainu Bappu Medal in 2002, and an Australian 
Research Council Federation Fellowship in 2005. In 2006 Schmidt was jointly 
awarded the US$1M Shaw Prize for Astronomy, and shared the US$0.5M 2007 
Gruber Prize for Cosmology with his High-Z SN Search Team colleagues. In 2008 
he was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the 
United States National Academy, and Foreign Member of the Spanish Royal 
Academy of Sciences. His work on the accelerating universe was awarded the 
2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Adam Riess and Saul Perlmutter. Brian 
is continuing his work using exploding stars to study the Universe, and is 
leading Mt Stromlo’s effort to build the SkyMapper telescope, a new facility 
that will provide a comprehensive digital map of the southern sky from 
ultraviolet through near infrared wavelengths.
