ICCV is the premier international Computer Vision event comprising
the main conference and several co-located workshops and short
courses. ICCV 2013 will host demonstrations whose purpose is to
give researchers the opportunity to showcase live demonstrations
of their contributions.
<br/><br/>
Members of the computer vision community are invited to submit
expressions of interest for demonstrations at ICCV 2013. These do
not need not be limited only to papers that are to be presented
at ICCV 2013. Researchers are encouraged to demonstrate the
ectiveness of methods described in papers presented in the past
conferences and in other venues, so long as they fall within the
broad context of ICCV.
<br/><br/>
Prospective demo participants should fill out and submit an
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xotPF9a_oLGPiD1xyG7iQtVdmeNf33WjRqnnkPCCJfs/viewform">expression of interest form</a> electronically. Please be advised that
all of the presenters for accepted demos must be registered at the
conference. If there are more applications than the available space
allows, the time of submission of the complete application will be
used for selection. The conference also reserves the right to select
demonstrations based on the degree of appropriateness for ICCV.
<br/><br/>
It is also important to note that, nonetheless demonstrations can
be made with the help of industrial partners, commercial products
should be presented as part of the ICCV exhibits, rather than
demonstrations.
<br/><br/>
Successful expressions of interest will be assigned 
oor space on a first-come-first-served basis taking into account the date of lodge-
ment, i.e. the date in which the expressions of interest was received.
