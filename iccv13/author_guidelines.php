<span class="iccv-bold-red">Please read the following submission instructions carefully, as some steps are new or have changed for ICCV 2013.</span>  Your submission will not be complete unless all of the steps below are followed. Instructions on <a href="#formatting">formatting your submission</a>, a description of the general <a href="#policies">ICCV 2013 policies</a>, and some <a href="#faq">frequently-asked questions</a> can be found at the bottom of this page.

<br><br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 1: Create a user account on the CMT paper submission site</span>
<ul>
  <li>Please follow <a target="_blank" href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ICCV2013/Public/SignUp.aspx">this link</a> to sign up as a new user on CMT.</li>
  <li>You can edit your contact information at any time (see item near the top right in the submission site). Don't forget to click the "Update" button to save the edited information. If you wish to change the contact email address, you can modify it via the "Change your Email" box.</li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> If you have already registered as an ICCV 2013 reviewer on CMT you can ignore this step.</li>
  <li><b>Note:</b> If you have generated an account and have forgotten your password, just click on "Reset your password". Instructions will be emailed to you.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 2: <span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Enter the domain of ONLY your current institution</span>
<ul>
  <li>The first time you <a target="_blank" href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ICCV2013/Default.aspx">log on to CMT</a> you will be asked to enter your "Conflict Domains".</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Please <b>ignore</b> CMT's instructions on the "Edit Conflict Domains" page about which domains to enter.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Please only enter the domain of the academic department or institution where you <b>currently</b> work or study (example: <i>cs.toronto.edu</i>). If you worked or studied at more than one institution <b>in the past year</b>, please enter the domain of each institution separated by semicolons (example: <i>cs.washington.edu; microsoft.com</i>).</li>
  <li>If your institution is a university, please enter the domain of your academic department rather than the whole university (i.e., enter <i>cs.washington.edu</i> rather than <i>washington.edu)</i></li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> <b>DO NOT</b> enter the institution domain names of your current or past co-authors: only your institution should be entered. ICCV 2013 will use a different mechanism to identify collaborator conflicts which does not rely on the information you enter on CMT.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> <b>DO NOT</b> enter the domain of your email providers such as gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, 163.com as your institution domain.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 3: Enter a title and abstract</span>
<br>
Your title can be up to 256 characters in length. The maximum size of the abstract is 4000 characters.
<br>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 4: Add your co-authors</span>
<br>
If your submission has co-authors, you will need to associate them with your submission:
<ul>
  <li>If your co-authors already have an account on CMT, please make sure you enter the email address that corresponds exactly to their account name. This will ensure that they can see your submission when they log onto CMT.</li>
  <li>If the email address you enter does not correspond to an existing CMT account for ICCV 2013, you will be asked to enter your co-author’s information (name, institution, etc).</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 5: <span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Select one TOP-LEVEL primary subject area for your paper</span>
<ul>
  <li>Select one TOP-LEVEL primary subject area for your paper.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Subject areas are organized hierarchically in two levels. Please choose a <b>top-level</b> subject area as the primary area of your paper. Pay extra attention to this choice, as it is critical in allowing us to properly assign papers to reviewers.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 6: Select up to five secondary subject areas</span>
<ul>
  <li>You may select any combination of top-level and lower-level subject areas. Pay extra attention to these choices, as they are critical in allowing us to properly assign papers to reviewers.</li>
  <li>Your primary subject area cannot be selected as a secondary subject area; if you select it, the system will not allow you to save. It is possible, however, to select secondary subject areas that lie below your primary subject area in the hierarchy. For example, if you have chosen "3D computer vision" for your primary subject area, you cannot choose "3D computer vision" as a secondary subject area but you can choose "Stereo correspondence".</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 7: <span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Optionally select up to five Preferred Area Chairs (ACs) for handling your paper</span>
<ul>
  <li>If you do select preferred ACs, your choices will be used to determine who will shepherd your paper through the reviewing process.</li>
  <li>You may consult <a target="_blank" href="ac_profiles.php">this webpage</a> for information about the ICCV 2013 Area Chairs: their names, websites, preferred subject areas, Google Scholar profiles, and publications on DBLP.</li>
  <li>Choosing Preferred ACs is <b>optional</b>. If you do not know which ACs to select, you may keep the default option ("No preference").</li>
  <li>Keep in mind that each AC can only handle a limited number of papers; <b>the more preferred ACs you specify the more likely it is that one of your choices will be available to handle your paper.</b></li>
  <li>The preferred AC drop-down list includes only the AC’s primary subject area. Since ACs can only specify one subject area as primary regardless of the breadth of their expertise, it is possible that your paper’s primary subject area is not included on this list, or that very few ACs have it as primary. You should consult <a target="_blank" href="ac_profiles.php">this webpage</a> to view the ACs’ secondary subject areas and their publication profiles to help you decide whom to choose.</li>
  <li><b>DO NOT</b> choose the same AC more than once.</li>
  <li><b>DO NOT</b> choose ACs who are in conflict of interest with either you or your submission's co-authors. Please see the <a href="#conflicts">ICCV 2013 conflict of interest policy</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 8: Include your paper ID</span>
<br>
Once you have registered your paper (i.e. title, subject areas, area chairs, etc), you will be assigned a paper ID by CMT. Insert this ID into the latex or word template before generating the PDF of your paper for submission.
<br>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 9: Upload your paper's PDF by April 12, 2013 (7:00 PM PDT [UTC-7:00])</span>
<ul>
  <li>Paper formatting instructions can be found <a href="#formatting">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Only PDF files are accepted (maximum size <b>20MB</b>).</li>
  <li>Make sure that your paper’s ID appears in the PDF.</li>
</ul>


<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Step 10: Optionally upload a supplementary materials file by April 17, 2013 (7:00 PM PDT [UTC-7:00])</span>
<ul>
  <li>The ICCV 2013 policy on supplementary materials can be found <a href="#supplementary">here</a>.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Only one PDF or ZIP file is accepted with a maximum size of <b>100MB</b>.</li>
  <li>You can update this file by uploading a new one (the old one will be deleted and replaced).</li>
  <li>The paper for review (PDF only) must be uploaded before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be uploaded.</li>
</ul>








<br><br>
<span class="iccvsectionheader"><a name="formatting"></a>Submission Formatting Instructions</span>
<br><br>
Please refer to the following files for detailed formatting instructions.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Example submission paper with detailed instructions: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (tar): <a href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/files/iccv2013AuthorKit.tgz">iccv2013AuthorKit.tgz</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (zip): <a href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/files/iccv2013AuthorKit.zip">iccv2013AuthorKit.zip</a></li>
</ul>
A complete paper should be submitted using the above templates, which are blind-submission review-formatted templates.
<br><br>
<span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> All accepted papers will be allocated up to 8 pages in the proceedings and will be charged a flat fee of US$200. That is, there is no savings for using fewer than 8 pages. This fee helps cover the cost of the reviewing process and will be paid after paper acceptance, at the time of registration for the conference. <b>Papers with more than 8 pages (including references) will be rejected without review.</b>
<br>




<br><br>
<span class="iccvsectionheader"><a name="supplementary"></a>Supplementary Materials</span>
<br><br>
Authors may optionally upload supplementary material (up to 100MB) which may include:
<ul>
  <li>videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system,</li>
  <li>images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper,</li>
  <li>anonymized related submissions to ICCV or other conferences and journals, and</li>
  <li>appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper.</li>
</ul>

ICCV encourages authors to submit videos using an MP4 codec such as DivX contained in an AVI. Also, please submit a README text file with each video specifying the exact codec used and a URL where the codec can be downloaded.
<br><br>
Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. Please note that:
<ul>
  <li>All supplementary material must be self-contained in a single file for upload (i.e., a single pdf, or a zip file containing multiple items).</li>
  <li>The supplementary material directly supports the paper as submitted prior to the paper deadline. ONLY results generated by the algorithm/approach/system reported in the submitted version are allowed. Material based on improvements subsequent to the paper deadline is not allowed.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> <b>DO NOT</b> include links to external files or websites (e.g., youtube). Including such links is grounds for automatic rejection without review.</li>
  <li><b>DO NOT</b> submit a newer version of the paper as supplementary material. Including a newer version of the paper or any portion thereof (whether a single spelling/typo correction or a description of an improved algorithm/approach/system) is strictly forbidden.</li>
</ul>




<br><br>
<span class="iccvsectionheader"><a name="policies"></a>Policies</span>
<br><br>

<span class="iccvparagraphheader">Author Responsibilities:</span> By submitting a manuscript to ICCV, authors agree
<ul>
  <li>to abide by all ICCV policies regarding <a href="#doubleblind">double-blind reviewing</a>, <a href="#dual">double submissions</a> and <a href="#conflicts">conflicts of interest</a>.</li>
  <li><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> to pay a publication fee of US$200 if the paper is accepted; this fee will be charged at the time of conference registration.</li>
  <li>that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader"><a name="doubleblind"></a>Double blind review:</span> ICCV reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and area chairs/reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please read Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a> for detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of these guidelines can lead to rejection.
<br><br>

<span class="iccvparagraphheader"><a name="dual"></a>Dual/Double Submissions:</span> By submitting a manuscript to ICCV, the authors guarantee that
<ul>
  <li>the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in an archival peer-reviewed forum.</li>
  <li>no paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper is under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the ICCV 2013 review period to another conference, workshop, or journal (April 12, 2013 to September 2, 2013).</li>
  <li>they did not submit substantially similar submissions to ICCV 2013.</li>
</ul>

Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection. If there are papers that may appear to violate any of above conditions, it is the authors' responsibility to (1) cite these papers (preserving anonymity as described in Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv13/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>), (2) argue in the body of your paper why the ICCV submission is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions, and (3) include anonymized versions of those submissions as supplemental material.
<br><br>
Note that a Technical Report (departmental, <a target="_blank" href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv.org</a>, etc.) that is disseminated without any form of direct peer review is NOT considered a publication. Likewise, mention of the work under review in a presentation is NOT considered a violation. For further information, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section_822F.html">Section 8.2.4.F</a> of the IEEE PSPB Operations Manual.
<br><br>

<span class="iccvparagraphheader"><a name="conflicts"></a><span class="iccv-bold-red">(NEW)</span> Conflicts of Interest:</span>  It is the primary author's responsibility to ensure that
<ul>
  <li>the domain name(s) entered on CMT is/are valid and represent his/her place(s) of employment or study in the last 12 months.</li>
  <li>no other domain names are included.</li>
  <li>the chosen Preferred Area Chairs do not have a conflict of interest with	 any of the submission’s authors (i.e., are currently at the same institution or have had a co-author/supervisor/supervisee relationship in the last 3 years).</li>
</ul>

Violations of these rules may lead to rejection without review.

<br>
<span class="iccvsectionheader"><a name="faq"></a>Author FAQs</span>
<br><br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">About Submitting Papers</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we please have an extension on the deadline?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> No extensions will be given and any incomplete submission or a submission not meeting required criteria will be deleted.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">The submission instructions ask me to enter only the domain name of my current institution in the "Conflict Domains" field but CMT’s instructions on the "Edit Conflict Domains" say otherwise. What should I do?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">You should <b>ignore</b> the instructions on the "Edit Conflict Domains" page. Please <b>only</b> enter the domain name of your current institution. <b>NO</b> past institutions (where you worked or studied more than 12 months ago), <b>NO</b> domain names of co-author/collaborator institutions, <b>NO</b> domain names of email providers should be entered. The instructions on the "Edit Conflict Domains" page on CMT are common across all conferences hosted by CMT and cannot be customized for ICCV13. We ask that you ignore them and follow the ICCV13-specific instructions.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">I entered my co-author domains as conflicts when I first logged on to CMT, but the paper submission instructions now say I should have only entered my institution’s domain. What should I do?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">You should go back to your Author Console and just enter your institution’s domain, per ICCV13’s submission instructions. Your "Conflict Domains" field can be edited at any time during the submission period.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">Since I am not entering the domains of my past collaborators, how will you determine which reviewers have a conflict of interest with my submission?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">We are using DBLP to collect every reviewer’s co-authors in the past 3 years. Papers written by these co-authors will be flagged as having a conflict with the reviewer.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">No Area Chair seems to have listed my paper’s subject area as primary. How should I choose my preferred AC?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">You should consult <a href="ac_profiles.php">this webpage</a> to get complete information about our ACs. Since ACs can only specify one subject area as primary regardless of the breadth of their expertise, they may have a similar level of interest and expertise in their secondary subject areas. If your paper’s primary subject area does not appear as secondary either, we recommend you look at the ACs’ publications.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">How will my paper’s Area Chair be determined if I do not select any preferred ACs?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">We will use the Toronto Paper Matching System as an additional source of information for AC-paper assignments.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">Can we get my quota increased for the size of paper submission from 20 MB to something higher?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> We have set hard limits of 20MB (PDF Only) for paper submission and 100MB (PDF or ZIP only) for supplementary materials for submissions for review. We are expecting many submissions and each reviewer is expected to review about 10 papers on average. Larger file downloads (and uploads) will burden the system and prevent reviewers from accessing papers quickly enough. Authors should consider adding high-resolution images as supplementary material. See the <a href="#supplementary">Supplementary Material</a> guidelines for more details.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">How do I delete Supplementary Material from the CMT site?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">After you log on to CMT, you will notice an "Update File" link next to the supplementary filename on the "Author Console". Click on that, and in the page that appears, you can click on the "Delete" button to remove the supplementary file. Note that you will not be able to delete the supplementary file after the supplementary file deadline.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we submit color images with our papers for review?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES.</b> Reviewers will download the exact pdf file of the paper you submitted, so they can see the color images on the screen. Nevertheless, many reviewers like to review submissions in hardcopy and may not have access to a high-end color printer. We suggest that you print your paper on a monochrome printer to verify that important information is not lost after monochrome printing. You may also wish to add a comment in your submission requesting the reviewers to view it in color, on a screen.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">What is the ICCV 2013 policy on DUAL SUBMISSIONS?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">See the <a href="#policies">Policies</a> section of this webpage.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a Technical Report (departmental, arXiv, etc.) with publication available online count as a prior publication?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> See the <a href="#policies">Policies</a> section of this webpage.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a presentation at a departmental seminar during the review period violate the anonymity standard or other ICCV 2013 policy?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> See the <a href="#policies">Policies</a> section of this webpage.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<span class="iccvparagraphheader">About the Review Process</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Is the ICCV 2013 Review Process CONFIDENTIAL?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES,</b> ICCV 2013 reviewing is considered confidential. All reviewers are required to treat every manuscript they review as a confidential document and not to share or distribute materials under review for any reason other than to facilitate the reviewing of the submitted work. Reviewers are obligated to remove or destroy them after review. Accepted papers will be published (with appropriate copyrights) with a date of around December 3, 2013. Please make sure to discuss this issue with your legal advisors as it pertains to public disclosure of the contents of the papers submitted.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Are ICCV 2013 Reviews Double BLIND or Single BLIND?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">ICCV reviewing is <b>Double BLIND</b>. Be sure to read the <a href="#policies">Policies</a> section of this webpage to avoid unintentional violations of the double-blind policy when writing your paper.</span></li>

<li><span class="faq_q">Is it guaranteed that my paper will be handled by one of my preferred ACs?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> While we will do our best to satisfy author preferences, each AC can only handle a limited number of papers. In addition, ACs have a choice as well: ACs will initially be assigned 60-80 papers (based on author preferences and the Toronto Paper Matching System), and then they will indicate which of these papers match their interests and expertise most closely. The final AC-paper assignment will be based on this input from ACs, subject to load-balancing constraints.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>


<span class="iccvparagraphheader">About Publications</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Since the ICCV 2013 proceedings are electronic/digital, why do we need to pay a fee if our paper is accepted? Where are these funds used?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">Every submitted paper increases the workload of reviewers and area chairs, and thus the cost of the reviewing and publication process. The fee helps defray these costs and is considered a better alternative to increasing the registration fees of every attendee. Note that this fee is normally covered by grants/contracts.</span></li>
