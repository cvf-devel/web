ICCV has a strong tradition of hosting exhibits of advanced computer vision technology, products, services and publications. In ICCV 2013, the exhibit tables will be strategically placed to foster interaction between the exhibitors and conference attendees, ensuring maximum exposure. 
<br/><br/>

We particularly encourage companies and other commercial entities or laboratories to participate in showcasing their products and services. It should be noted, however, that exhibits should be related to commercial products or services. If you are intending to demonstrate non-commercial applications of research published at ICCV or elsewhere, please go to the  <a href="demo_info.php">ICCV 2013 demo web page</a>.
<br/><br/>

The exhibitors must fill in an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kjwwP2jWU6OoRuICOUAP6-FrQOYmrujipUTI-3QevbI/viewform">electronic expression of interest </a> and agree to the terms and conditions in the <a href="files/EPv04.pdf">Exhibitor Prospectus</a>. All expressions of interest should be submitted on-line by Sunday 29 September 2013.
<br/><br/>
