<p><b>Note: in addition to the instructions below, all authors need to
<a href="extended_abstracts.php">submit an extended abstract</a>, also
due at April 10, 2015 at 11:59pm Pacific Time.</b></p>

<p>Please read these instructions carefully and follow them exactly
to minimize problems with production of the conference
proceedings.</p>

<p>The deadline for final submission (completion of all steps
below) is April 10, 2015 at 11:59pm Pacific Time. This deadline will
not be extended. Papers that arrive after the deadline may not appear
on the conference USB drive, and may not be placed in IEEE
Xplore.</p>

<p>Note: Conference attendees will receive a conference USB drive
containing all the papers (and supplementary material) for the main
conference as well as the associated workshops. The conference USB
drive will not be available for purchase after the meeting. They are
published exclusively for meeting attendees. All CVPR papers that are
submitted on time, which are compliant with IEEE Xplore, and for which
the IEEE copyright has been completed, will be placed in IEEE Xplore
shortly after the meeting. Only those papers that are placed in IEEE
Xplore can be considered archival.</p>

<p>There are four steps to completing your final CVPR 2015 paper
submission:</p>

<ol type="1" class="body_ul">
<li>Validate your camera-ready paper (without page numbers) using IEEE PDF eXpress.</li>
<li>Register at least one author for CVPR 2015.</li>
<li>Submit the validated PDF and paper information to the paper collection site (<a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/CVPR2015/">https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/CVPR2015/</a>).</li>
<li>Complete and submit the IEEE Electronic Copyright form.</li>
</ol>

These steps are detailed below.

<br /><br /><hr /><br />

<ol type="1" class="body_ul">

<li>Use IEEE PDF eXpress to validate your paper for inclusion in IEEE Xplore.<br />

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not include page numbers in your camera-ready paper.</p>

<p>There is a strict size limit of 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes) for PDF
files in the conference proceedings.  If your paper is larger than
this, you are probably using very large images in your figures. As a
rule, your images will look fine at 600 pixels per inch and you should
down-sample the images used in your figures accordingly. Smaller PDF
files are also validated more quickly by PDF eXpress.</p>

<p>The page limit for all papers is 8 pages, not including
references and acknowledgments.  To clarify, the main body of the
paper, including figures, tables, equations, etc., must be limited to
no more than 8 pages.  Additional pages may only contain an
acknowledgments section or cited references. Note that, unlike
previous years, there are no extra-page fees.  However, papers that
are longer than 8 pages (not including references and
acknowledgments), will not be processed and will not appear on the
conference USB drive or on IEEE Xplore.</p>

<pan>IEEE requires that all papers to be entered into the IEEE Xplore
digital library meet the IEEE style guidelines. LaTeX and MS-Word
style files compatible with IEEE requirements are available through
the <a href="http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr15/author_guidelines.php">CVPR
2015 web site</a>.</p>

<p>Papers that do not meet these guidelines will not be placed in
Xplore. This is IEEE policy.</p>

<p>Note: PDF eXpress does not collect the papers. After validating
your paper, you must still upload it to the camera-ready paper
collection website (CMT) for production, as described in Step
4.</p>

<p>There are two ways to use IEEE PDF eXpress. If you generate your
own PDF file, PDF eXpress can validate it. If you are using any of the
following document formatting systems, PDF eXpress can generate an
Xplore-compliant document from the following source files: MS-Word,
WordPerfect, RTF (rich text format), Freelance, LaTeX, PageMaker,
FrameMaker, Word Pro, or Quark.  If you used LaTeX, PageMaker, or
Quark to prepare your paper, there are a few extra steps required to
supply the images to IEEE.</p>

<ol type="a" class="body_ul">
<li>Login to PDF express: <a href="https://www.pdf-express.org/">https://www.pdf-express.org/</a><br /><br />

The conference ID is: 31182X</li>

<li>If you have not used PDF eXpress before, you must create an
account. Click the "New User" button and follow the instructions.  If
you have used PDF eXpress for a previous conference, you can log in
using your previous email address and password; it will then ask you
to create an account for this conference by entering a password--it
can be the same password.  Verify (and update if necessary) your
contact information and click "Submit". Once you have an account, you
can login as often as you need to process all of your papers.</li>

<li>Create a new title for each paper that you are submitting.</li>

<li>Submit the PDF file you wish to validate, or submit the source
files you wish to convert. PDF eXpress will digest the file(s)
submitted and send you e-mail with the validation result, or the
generated PDF, as appropriate.</li>

<li>Repeat step d until you are satisfied with the result.</li>

<li>Go to step c to process your other papers.</li>
</ol>

<p>A primary source of failure in validating a PDF file is the use
of non-embeddable fonts in figures. Make sure that your paper uses
embeddable fonts for the main text of the paper as well as the
figures, figure captions, references, footnotes, etc. Another source
of failure is the line in the LaTeX source file that includes the
hyperref package.  If you are having difficulty, you may want to
comment out this line. If you have further trouble with IEEE PDF
eXpress, contact <a
href="mailto:pdfsupport@ieee.org">pdfsupport@ieee.org</a></p>
</li>

<li>Register at least one author for the conference at <a
href="http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr15/">http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr15/</a>
or by following the Registration link from the main CVPR 2015 web
page. At least one author for each paper must register to attend the
meeting.  If there is not one author registered for the meeting, the
paper will not be included in the proceedings and it will not appear
in IEEE Xplore.  Likewise, papers and posters that are not presented
due to no-shows will not appear in IEEE Xplore.<br /></li>

<li>Final paper submission for production<br />

<p>Deadline: April 10, 2015. The deadline for all CVPR 2015 papers is April 10, 2015 at 11:59pm Pacific Time.  This deadline will not be extended.  Papers that arrive after the deadline may not appear on the conference USB drive, and may not be placed in IEEE Xplore.</p>

<ol type="a" class="body_ul">
<li>Login to the CMT paper collection site: <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/CVPR2015/">https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/CVPR2015/</a></li>

<li>In the CMT "Author Console", your accepted paper(s) will appear
with an "Edit" link in the "Camera-Ready | Presentations" column.
Click on the "Edit" link to take you to the camera-ready submission
page for your accepted paper.  DO NOT click on the "Submit IEEE
Copyright Form" at this time.  You will submit the electronic
copyright form later (in Step 4 below)--after updating your paper
title and author list and submitting your camera-ready paper.</li>

<li><p>After reading the camera-ready submission "Welcome" screen, press
the "Next" link in the bottom-right corner (or press the "Title &amp;
Abstract" link on the left) to go the the "Title &amp; Abstract" page.
Update/correct (if necessary) the paper title and abstract to match
your camera-ready submission.</p>

<p>NOTE: Please ensure that the abstract is updated with your most
recent version and that it is submitted as plain text without any
LaTex (or other form of) markup. This will facilitate inclusion of
your paper (and abstract) into the CVF Open Access archive.  The
abstract is posted on CVF as plain text without modification as it's
received from CMT--if it looks messy because it's submitted as plain
text with LaTex markup, it will look messy on CVF.</p>

<p>After completing each section of the camera-ready submission,
advance to the next section by pressing the "Next" link in the
bottom-left of the page or by clicking directly on the appropriate
page link on the left.</p></li>

<li>In the "Authors" page, update/correct (if necessary) the author
list for your paper.  Check that all the authors included in the
camera-ready paper also appear in their proper order on CMT.  Use the
"Add Author" button to add a co-author to your paper.  Please check
that all author names are spelled correctly and are in the correct
order.</li>

<li>The name of your camera-ready submission must be in the form
XXXX.pdf where XXXX is the four-digit paper ID (zero-padded if
necessary). For example, if your paper ID is 24, the filename must be
0024.pdf.  Rename your camera-ready PDF file that was validated by PDF
eXpress and upload it (and optionally a supplemental file) in the
"File Upload" page.</li>

<li>If you wish to provide supplementary material, the file name must
be in the form XXXX-supp.pdf or XXXX-supp.zip, where XXXX is the
zero-padded, four-digit paper ID as used in step e.  Upload your
supplemental file on the "File Upload" page as a single PDF or ZIP
file of 20 MB in size or less. Only PDF and ZIP files are allowed for
supplementary material. You can put anything in this file - movies,
code, additional results, accompanying technical reports - anything
that may make your paper more useful to readers. If your supplementary
material includes video or image data, you are advised to use common
codecs and file formats. This will make the material viewable by the
largest number of readers (a desirable outcome).  Please note that
supplemental material will only be included on the USB proceedings; it
will NOT be archived on IEEE Xplore.</li>

<li>Check that the upload of your file (or files) was successful
either by matching the file length to that on your computer, or by
using the download options that will appear after you have
uploaded. Please ensure that you upload the correct camera-ready
PDF--validated by PDF eXpress and renamed to XXXX.pdf as described in
step 3.e--as your camera-ready submission.  Every year there is at
least one author that accidentally submits the wrong PDF as their
camera-ready submission.</li>

<li>You must agree to all the questions on the "Additional Questions"
page.  You will not be allowed to complete the camera-ready submission
process until all of the questions on this page have been answered
with "I Agree."</li>

<li>Don't forget to click the "Finish" button on the "Confirmation"
page to save all your changes.  Unless you press the "Finish" button,
any changes you've made to the camera-ready submission--including file
uploads and changes to title, abstract, and author list will not be
saved.</li>

<li>Before you can complete your paper submission, you must first
complete and submit the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form as described in
Step 4 below.  After completing the electronic copyright, you should
be able to complete the paper submission process. If you submit a
paper more than once, the paper collection site will remember that you
have already filled out the copyright form for that paper so that you
don't have to resubmit the electronic copyright.<br /><br />

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that once you submit your IEEE
Electronic Copyright form, you will not be able to go back and make
changes.  IEEE does not have any mechanism to redo an electronic
copyright form and you will not be able to complete more than one form
per paper.  As such, please be sure that the title, author list,
etc. are correct and final on the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form prior
to completing and submitting the copyright form.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Complete and digitally sign the IEEE Electronic Copyright
Form for your paper and submit it along with your final paper.<br />

<p>To complete your camera-ready submission, you must complete the
IEEE Electronic Copyright Form and then upload the completed form to
CMT.  To do this, you will select the "Submit IEEE Copyright Form" in
the CMT "Author Console".  You must follow the instructions for
completing, downloading, and submitting the copyright form.  During
this process, you will be transferred to an IEEE site to complete and
submit the copyright form.  Once the copyright is completed and
downloaded, you will be returned to CMT to upload the IEEE Electronic
Copyright form to CMT.  Again, the copyright form can be completed
only once per paper, so please make sure that all the information on
the form is complete and final (including changes to paper title and
authors) prior to submission (see important note below).  This must be
done by the April 10, 2015 deadline.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware that once you submit your IEEE
Electronic Copyright form, you will not be able to go back and make
changes.  IEEE does not have any mechanism to "redo"" an electronic
copyright form and you will not be able to complete more than one form
per paper.  As such, please be sure that the title, author list,
etc. are correct and final on the IEEE Electronic Copyright Form prior
to completing and submitting the copyright form.</p>

<p>Papers without completed copyright forms will not appear on the
conference proceedings disk and will not be enrolled in IEEE
Xplore.</p></li>
</ol>

<br /><hr /><br />

<p>Final reminder: Papers will appear in the CVPR 2015 USB
proceedings and placed in IEEE Xplore only if all of these conditions
are met:</p>
