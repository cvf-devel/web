<p>Dear CVPR 2015 presenter,</p>

<p>Please find below all the information you need for your

conference. Please direct any questions to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01o-JggXPEc57LDs8XC7Dk_g==&amp;c=UTgHp8DWNzHhO506iwAsWg==" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501o-JggXPEc57LDs8XC7Dk_g\75\75\46c\75UTgHp8DWNzHhO506iwAsWg\75\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">Mike Jones</a>.</p>

<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Oral sessions:</span>

<ul>

<li><b>Oral presenters</b> should be present at the podium (in the
correct room) at least 10 minutes before the start of the
<b>session</b> and should introduce themselves to the session chairs
as soon as they arrive. You can check your session <a
href="program.php">here</a>.</li>

<li><b>Your talk will be recorded.</b> Please note the <b>May 29th</b>
deadline for submitting your Release Form, see <a
href="#recording">recording details below</a>.</li>

<li>If you require any special assistance during your talk or to get to the podium, please let the session chair know of this before the session or email the <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=017ZRqNZ7cqo3l_BJoipSiog==&amp;c=9v-TZXHgTg1r5jMztKS4regmvRS8dUJvJs-hUo1iJmI=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\075017ZRqNZ7cqo3l_BJoipSiog\75\75\46c\759v-TZXHgTg1r5jMztKS4regmvRS8dUJvJs-hUo1iJmI\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">Program Chairs</a>.</li>

<li>Oral speakers should test their own laptops with the projector
before the session, to avoid any technical difficulties.</li>

<li>Oral talks are given 13 minutes plus 2 minutes for questions. This
includes time for switching between speakers and the introduction. You
will be asked to leave the podium once your time is up.  Please make
sure you do not exceed the given time limit.</li>

<li>Each oral presenter will also present their work as a poster. Your
poster is scheduled for the first poster session following the oral
session of your paper. This is a good opportunity to expose the work
further and get extra feedback from the CVPR attendees.</li>

</ul>


<span class="cvprparagraphheader">Poster sessions:</span>

<ul>

<li>Each poster is assigned a specific poster stand identified by
paper id as specified in the <a
href="files/CVPR_2015_Pocket_Guide_Final.pdf">pocket guide</a>. Check
with the volunteers or the registration desk if you cannot find your
poster board.</li>

<li>The physical dimensions of the poster stands that will be
available this year are 8 feet wide by 4 feet high. Please review the
<a href="files/cvpr15-poster-template-n.ppt">CVPR15 poster
template</a> for more details on how to prepare your poster. You do
not need to use this template, but please read the instructions
carefully and prepare your posters accordingly.</li>

<li>Poster presenters are asked to install their posters between 8am
and 10am for morning poster sessions and between 2:00pm and 3:30pm for
afternoon poster sessions.  Push pins will be provided for attaching
posters to the boards.  Please remove posters promptly at the
conclusion of each poster session, since the display boards are reused
in each session.  In particular, afternoon posters must be removed at
6:00pm, as reservation of conference space ends at this time.</li>

</ul>
