	<p>CVPR is one of the premier Computer Vision events
	  comprising a main conference and numerous co-located
	  workshops and tutorials. CVPR 2015 will continue the
	  successful tradition of allowing researchers to present live
	  demonstrations of their work.</p>

	<p>Persons interested in the demo program at CVPR 2015 should
	  submit a demonstration application form (see above) by April
	  3, 2015.</p>

	<p>Note that demos do not need to be limited to only papers
	  that are presented at the main conference or associated
	  workshops. All contributions relevant to the computer vision
	  community are welcomed.</p>

	<p>Please be advised that all of the presenters for accepted
	  demos must be registered at the conference. Demos will be
	  selected based on their appropriateness for CVPR. If there
	  are more applications than the available space allows, the
	  time of submission of the demo application form will be
	  considered as a factor in the selection process, with
	  earlier submissions being given preference.</p>

	<p>Please note that demos by persons representing commercial
	  products are welcome, but should be part of the CVPR
	  exhibitions, rather than demonstrations. For more details on
	  exhibitions, please see the
	  <a href="sponsor_exhibitor_info.php#exhibitor">2015
	    exhibitor information</a>.</p>
