Student Volunteers</span><br />

<a href="http://goo.gl/3h1q3e">Student volunteer application
form</a><br /><br />

What you need to do as a student volunteer: work for 2-3 shifts (each
about 2 hours) during the course of the conference.  Work involves
transporting materials, attending to registrations at the desk,
running between various sessions to help the session chairs, etc.
<br /><br />

What you get in return as a student volunteer: your conference
registration fee is waived.  (We ask that you register as normal and
once you have satisfied your volunteer duties, we will refund the
registration.)<br /><br />

Only current students are eligible to be student volunteers.<br /><br />

Applications received before April 15, 2014 will receive full
consideration, but applications will be accepted until all student
volunteer positions are filled.<br /><br />

If you have any questions, please contact the student volunteers chair

Young Researchers</span><br />

<a href="http://goo.gl/W6yzgf">Young researcher support application
form</a><br /><br />

This application is for young researchers in the computer vision
community who may need support to attend CVPR 2014. At this time we
are unable to determine the exact amount of support or reimbursement
we are able to give as it depends on the overall number of
registrations and other elements of the conference costs. So, our plan
is to have you fill in this application form and also pay for the full
registration. Then, as the conference date approaches, we will be in
touch regarding the amount (if any) of support we can provide. This
will most likely come in the form of a reimbursement for your
conference fees, but it also may require that you help during the
conference, as a volunteer.<br /><br />

Only young researchers with accepted papers at the main conference are
eligible to apply.<br /><br />

If you have any questions, please contact the student volunteers chair
