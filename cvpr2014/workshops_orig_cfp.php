Workshop Chairs, Jim Davis and Margrit Betke (<a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01yUz0rGQ4i8l0bX0HFQrnmw==&c=s0w8_9xI_cDOmerbCvFmJs1wnFfCfxP1-_pWP5IjUq6FPio4PqBo4NEwN8QdGUXH" title="Reveal this e-mail address">email</a>)

Proposals for workshops are solicited for the 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2014) in Columbus, Ohio. Workshops will take place on June 23 and June 28, 2014, at the same venue as the main CVPR conference.
<br><br>
Appropriate subjects for workshops include topics from computer vision as well as related fields or application areas. We solicit workshops of interest to a significant cross-section of the community and whose organizers have a strong track record in the field. Proposals that emphasize formats and/or programs that are unique to workshops, such as a large proportion of invited speakers or being based on a competition, are specifically encouraged.
<br><br>
Workshop proposals can be sent to the Workshop Chairs (<a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01yUz0rGQ4i8l0bX0HFQrnmw==&c=s0w8_9xI_cDOmerbCvFmJs1wnFfCfxP1-_pWP5IjUq6FPio4PqBo4NEwN8QdGUXH" title="Reveal this e-mail address">email</a>).  A proposal should include the following information:
<ol>
<li>Title, topic and sample call for papers;
<li>Justification of the workshop, including the relationship to the previous ones, the novelty of the proposed workshop, and the reason why the proposed workshop may interest the community.
<li>Names and contacts of the organizers;
<li>Tentative program committee, invited speakers if any;
<li>Estimated attendance;
<li>Estimated number of submissions and acceptance rate;
<li>Estimated breakdown among oral, poster presentations, and invited talks;

Decisions will be made by December 2, 2013.
