<span class="iccvsectionheader">Submission Instructions</span>
<br />

<p>All submissions will be handled electronically via the conference's <a href="https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ICCV2015/">CMT Website</a>. (The submission site will not open until April 1 at 5PM EDT.) By submitting a paper, the authors agree to the policies stipulated below.</p>

<p>The <b>paper and author registration deadline</b> is <b>Wednesday
  April 15th</b>, the <b>submission deadline</b> is <b>Wednesday April
  22th</b>. <b>Supplementary material</b> can be submitted until
  <b>Wednesday April 29th</b>.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Paper and Author
Registration:</span> By the paper and author registration deadline,
authors must submit a temporary paper title, a temporary abstract, and
a complete and final list of authors, their institutions and their
institutional conflict information. After this deadline, you will not
be able to register new papers, or modify authors for papers you
already registered, but you will still be able to edit the title and
subject areas. In CMT, users are identified by their emails and each
time CMT is used for a new conference a new CMT account is
created. Therefore, to manage conflicts, it is extremely important
that each CMT user has <b>one and only one CMT account for ICCV
2015</b>, even if the user has multiple roles (e.g., author and area
chair, author and reviewer). To ensure that each user has only one
account, before adding a co-author to a paper, the primary author
should contact each co-author to ask him/her if he/she already has a
CMT account for ICCV 2015 or not. If your co-author already has a CMT
account (e.g., he/she is an area chair or reviewer for ICCV 2015), you
must use the SAME email for which he/she already has an
account. Otherwise, you will create a different CMT account for the
same user. If your co-author does not have a CMT account for ICCV
2015, then please ask him/her which email he/she wishes to use so that
the email of each co-author is the SAME for all of his/her ICCV
submissions. After adding a co-author, please contact him/her to make
sure that he/she inputs his/her own institution and conflict
information (see conflict responsibilities below). Please note that,
in CMT, institution (e.g., Johns Hopkins University) and institutional
conflict (e.g., jhu.edu) are NOT the same thing and that CMT does not
automatically infer one from the other: both need to be completed by
each co-author. <b>Papers whose authors have incorrect or incomplete
institutions or conflict information may be summarily rejected without
review.</b></p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Conflict Responsibilities:</span> It
is the primary author's responsibility to contact all co-authors to
ensure that they have registered their institutional conflicts into
CMT. After the paper and author registration deadline this cannot be
changed anymore.</p>

<!-- 
Each author should enter the domain of his/her current institution
(example: jhu.edu; microsoft.com) to specify his/her institutional
conflict. Please enter ONLY ONE institutional conflict, except if you
were affiliated with more than one institution in the last 12 months
(April 2014 - April, 2015). DO NOT enter the domain of email providers
such as gmail.com.
-->

<p>Each author should enter the primary domain of his/her current
institution, not the secondary domain of your department (e.g., use
"jhu.edu" instead of "cs.jhu.edu"). Please enter ONLY ONE
institutional conflict domain, except if your institution has multiple
domains (e.g. "uni-heidelberg.de; uni-hd.de" or "uiuc.edu;
illinois.edu"), or if you were affiliated with more than one
institution in the last 12 months (April 2014 - April, 2015). DO NOT
enter the domain of email providers such as "gmail.com", "yahoo.com",
"hotmail.com" and "163.com" as your institutional conflict.</p>

Example 1: mit.edu<br />
Example 2: mit.edu; inria.fr<br />
Example 3: google.com; ox.ac.uk<br />
Example 4: inria.fr; ens.fr; iiit.ac.in<br />

<p>Note that your institutional conflict information is not
automatically extracted from your email or from the name of your
institution, thus you must enter it here.</p>

<p>DO NOT enter the email addresses or email domains of other
individuals with whom you have a conflict due to advisor/advisee
relationship, or a current or past (last 48 months) co-authorship or
collaboration: We will mine advising, co-authorship and collaboration
conflicts automatically using specialized software. The institutional
conflict information you provide will be used in conjunction with the
advising, co-authorship and collaboration conflict information that we
will collect in order to resolve assignments to both reviewers and
area chairs. <b>If a paper
is found to have an undeclared or incorrect institutional conflict,
  the paper may be summarily rejected.</b></p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Paper Submission:</span> By the
paper submission deadline, the authors must submit the final title,
abstract, primary and secondary areas, and a complete version of their
paper in PDF format. The authors may optionally suggest the names of
three Area Chairs whose expertise best matches the topic of their
paper. Please make sure that the AC is not conflicted with your paper
(same institution, advisor/advisee relationship,
co-authorship/collaboration in the last 48 months). You can find a
list of ACs and their expertise at <a
href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/ac_profiles.php">http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/ac_profiles.php</a>. Please
use the following submission instructions and blind-submission
review-formatted templates to prepare your submission:</p> <ul>
<li>Example submission paper with detailed instructions: <a
target="_blank"
href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (tar): <a
href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/iccv2015AuthorKit.tgz">iccv2015AuthorKit.tgz</a></li>
<li>LaTeX/Word Templates (zip): <a
href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/iccv2015AuthorKit.zip">iccv2015AuthorKit.zip</a></li>
</ul> <p>The paper length should match that intended for final
publication. Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and
tables. One additional page containing only cited references is
allowed. <b>Papers that are not blind, or do not use the template, or
have more than 8 pages (excluding 1 page for references) will be
rejected without review.</b></p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Supplementary Material Submission:</span> By
the supplementary material submission deadline, the authors may
optionally submit additional material that was ready at the time of
paper submission but could not be included in the main paper due to
constraints of format (e.g., a video), space (e.g., a proof of a
theorem or an extra figure or table) or anonymity (e.g., a concurrent
submission to ICCV or to another conference). Please <a href="#supp">see below</a>
for detailed instructions on supplementary materials.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Rebuttal and Revised Paper: </span>After
receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to
the reviewers' comments, which will be limited to 4000 characters. The
authors may also optionally upload a new version of the paper that
addresses the reviewers' comments. In this case, the changes between
the original submission and the revised version MUST be minimal (as
they are meant to address only the reviewers' comments) and MUST be
highlighted in red to facilitate checking the changes. The revised
version must adhere to the same blind-submission review-formatted
template as the original submission.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Camera Ready Paper:</span> If
your paper is accepted for publication, by the camera-ready deadline
you should submit a final version of your paper which is identical to
either the original or revised version of your paper (if you submitted
one as part of the rebuttal), except that (1) you may correct typos
and do minimal changes requested by the reviewers or area chairs in
their final recommendation, and (2) you must use the camera ready
template with the authors' names, affiliations and acknowledgements
included. Notice that you are not allowed to add new material
(theorems, algorithms, experiments) which were not reviewed by the
reviewers, except in very unusual circumstances where this was
requested by the area chairs.</p>

<br />
<span class="iccvsectionheader">Policies</span>
<br>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Review Process:</span> By
submitting a paper to ICCV, the authors agree to the review process
and understand that papers are processed by the <a
href="http://papermatching.cs.toronto.edu/webapp/profileBrowser/">Toronto
Paper Matching System (TPMS)</a> to match each manuscript to the best
possible area chairs and reviewers.  (<a href="ac_profiles.php">See
here for area chair subject areas.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Double Blind Review:</span> ICCV
reviewing is double blind, in that authors do not know the names of
the area chair/reviewers of their papers, and area chairs/reviewers do
not know the names of the authors. Please read Section 1.6 of the
  example paper <a href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>
for detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Avoid
providing information that may identify the authors in the
acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the
supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached
papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. <b>Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection
  without review.</b></p>

<p>If you are submitting another paper concurrently to any venue
(including ICCV) and the concurrent submission is related to your ICCV
submission or may be perceived as being related to your ICCV
submissions by the reviewers (e.g., the reviewer may be able to better
assess the novelty of your paper by having access to both
submissions), then the authors should (1) cite these concurrent
submissions (preserving anonymity as described in Section 1.6 of the
example paper <a href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>),
(2) argue in the body of your ICCV paper why your ICCV paper is non
trivially different from these concurrent submissions, and (3) include
anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material. In
case of any doubt, please contact the <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01b2Y5D8tdqnC681o3lUBqaA%3D%3D&c=i1R8Kw4ta3EJYjNPwn4AtpLelsrG8arnUb37knFdzSo%3D">Program Chairs</a>
well ahead of the paper submission deadline for clarifications.</p>

<p>If you submitted a version of your ICCV submission to arxiv.org, to
preserve anonymity, you should not cite the arxiv paper in your ICCV
submission. If you need to refer to material in the arxiv paper which
does not appear in the body of your ICCV submission, then you should
anonymize the arxiv paper and submit it to ICCV as supplementary
material so that you can refer to it in the body of your paper while
preserving anonymity.</p>

<p>Giving a talk about your ICCV 2015 submission is <b>NOT</b> considered
  a violation of the double-blind review process.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Plagiarism:</span> IEEE defines
plagiarism as the reuse of someone else's prior ideas, processes,
results, or words without explicitly acknowledging the original author
and source. It is important for all IEEE authors to recognize that
plagiarism in any form, at any level, is unacceptable and is
considered a serious breach of professional conduct, with potentially
severe ethical and legal consequences. Note that we will be actively
checking for plagiarism. Each violation will be reported to the
IEEE. For further information, please refer to <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/Section_822F.html">Section
  8.2.4.F</a> of the IEEE PSPB Operations Manual.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader" id="dual">Dual/Double Submissions:</span> By
submitting a manuscript to ICCV, authors acknowledge that it has not
been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially
similar form in any peer-reviewed venue with publicly accessible
papers, including journals, conferences, workshops, or other
peer-reviewed, archival forums. Furthermore, no paper substantially
similar in content has been or will be submitted to another
peer-reviewed conference or workshop with publicly accessible papers
during the review period (April 2015 - August 2015). The authors also
attest that they did not submit a substantially similar submission to
ICCV 2015. As a rule of thumb, the ICCV submission should contain no
more than 20 percent of material from previous publications. <b>Violation
  of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.</b></p>

<p>Our policy is based upon the following particular definition of
  "publication". A <i>publication</i>, for the purposes of the dual
submission policy, is defined to be a <i>written work that was
  submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection</i>,
  and, after review and acceptance, <i>can be publicly accessed</i>. In
particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon
whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings
or whether the organizers declare that such work "counts as a
publication".</p>

<p>Consider the following examples of previous work with regard to the
  dual submission policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A CVPR/ICCV/ECCV workshop paper with substantial overlap would
  generally be a violation of the dual submission policy because most
  a CVPR/ICCV/ECCV workshops accept or reject papers based upon
  peer-review and make the papers accessible via IEEExplore or
  Springer LNCS.</li>
  <li>A NIPS/ICML workshop paper with substantial overlap would
  generally be a violation of the dual submission policy because most
  NIPS/ICML workshops accept or reject papers based upon peer-review
  and make the papers accessible via the workshop's webpage or the
  author's webpage.</li>
  <li>An extended abstract on the same topic submitted would not be a
  violation of the dual submission policy. Such abstracts typically
  comprise 1-3 pages depending on the respective format and will not
  substantially overlap with a full paper ICCV submission. Examples
  are 1-page abstract submissions to <a href="http://sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/SPARS2015/WebHome">SPARS 2015</a> or 2-3 page submissions to the workshop track of <a href="http://www.iclr.cc/doku.php">ICLR 2015</a>.</li>
  <li>A technical report and/or an arXiv.org paper with substantial
  overlap that has not been submitted for peer-review to any other
  venue would not be a violation of the dual submission policy because
  this paper is not peer-reviewed for acceptance or rejection, and
  hence it would not qualify as a prior publication. However, if any
  excerpt or substantially similar version of the technical report or
  arXiv.org paper has been submitted for peer-review, then the general
  rules for double/dual policy submissions apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of any doubt, please contact the <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01b2Y5D8tdqnC681o3lUBqaA%3D%3D&c=i1R8Kw4ta3EJYjNPwn4AtpLelsrG8arnUb37knFdzSo%3D">Program Chairs</a> well
ahead of the paper submission deadline for clarifications.</p>

<p>An extended version of a paper submitted to ICCV (with sufficiently
new material) can be submitted to a journal anytime after the ICCV
submission deadline (even before a final decision on the paper is sent
to the authors). An author submitting an extended version of an ICCV
paper to a journal needs to ensure that the paper (a) satisfies all
submission requirements of the intended journal (e.g., most likely the
ICCV submission should be included as supplementary material to the
journal and the author should explain why the journal submission is
nontrivially different to the ICCV submission) and (b) does not
violate any copyright with IEEE. Authors may also wish to notify the <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01b2Y5D8tdqnC681o3lUBqaA%3D%3D&c=i1R8Kw4ta3EJYjNPwn4AtpLelsrG8arnUb37knFdzSo%3D">Program Chairs</a> of their journal submission.</p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Publication:</span> All accepted
papers will be made publicly available by the Computer Vision
Foundation (CVF) two weeks before the conference. Authors wishing to
submit a patent understand that the paper becomes of public domain
after the final (camera-ready) version is submitted. More information
about CVF is available at <a href="http://www.cv-foundation.org/">http://www.cv-foundation.org/</a></p>

<p><span class="iccvparagraphheader">Attendance Responsibilities:</span> The
authors agree that if the paper is accepted, at least one of the
authors will register for the conference and present the paper there.</p>


<br>
<span class="iccvsectionheader" id="supp">Supplementary Material</span>
<br><br>
Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may not fit in the PDF size limit and may include:
<ul>
  <li>videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system
    that were ready at the time of paper submission, but could not be
    included in the body of the paper due to reasons of format,</li>
  <li>images, tables and other results that were ready at the time of
  paper submission, but could not be included in the body of the paper
  due to reasons of space,</li>
  <li>anonymized related submissions to ICCV or other conferences and
    journals, and</li>
  <li>appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and
  mathematical derivations of results that are presented in the paper
  but could not be included due to reasons of space and are not
  essential to the understanding of the submitted paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>ICCV encourages authors to submit videos using an MP4 codec such as
DivX contained in an AVI. Also, please submit a README text file with
each video specifying the exact codec used and a URL where the codec
can be downloaded.</p>

<p>The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary
material appropriately in the paper. Note that reviewers will be
encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. Please note
that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The paper for review (PDF only) must be submitted <b>first</b>
  before the supplementary material (PDF or ZIP only) can be
  submitted.</li>
  <li>All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped
into a single file.  The following formats are allowed: avi, doc,
docx, mp4, pdf, wmv. CMT imposes a 100MB limit on the size of this
file. Note that you can update the file by uploading a new one (the
old one will be deleted and replaced).</li>
  <li>Please make sure that the supplementary material directly
  supports the paper as submitted prior to the paper deadline. ONLY
  results generated by the algorithm/approach/system reported in the
  submitted version are allowed. Material based on improvements
  subsequent to the paper deadline is not allowed. In particular, new
  experiments on new datasets, new experiments on the same datasets
  obtained by using new parameters or by re-training the model are NOT
  allowed.</li>
  <li><b>Do not submit a newer version of the paper as supplementary material.</b>
 A newer version of the paper or portion thereof, with description of
 an improved algorithm/approach/system or even one spelling or typo
 correction, is not allowed.</li>
</ol>

<span class="iccvsectionheader">Author FAQs</span>
<br><br>
<span class="iccvparagraphheader">About Submitting Papers</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we please have an extension on the deadline?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> And any incomplete submission or a submission 
not meeting required criteria will be deleted.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we get my quota increased for the size of paper submission from 30 MB to something higher?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> We have set hard limits of 30MB (PDF
Only) for paper submission and 100MB (PDF or ZIP only) for
supplementary materials for submissions for review. As we are
expecting many submissions, and as each reviewer is expected to review
(on average) about 10 papers, we feel that larger file downloads (and
uploads) will tax the system and abilities of reviewers to get to the
papers fast enough. Authors should consider adding hi-res images as
supplementary material. See <a href="#supp">Supplementary Material</a> above.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">How do I delete Supplementary Material from the CMT site?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">We have added a feature that allows authors to 
remove supplementary files. After you log in, in the "Author" console, 
you'll notice "Upload/Delete File" at the end of the supplementary file 
name. Click on that, and in the page that appears, you can click on the 
"Delete" button to remove the supplementary file. (Please note that you 
will not be able to delete the supplementary file after the 
supplementary file deadline.)</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Can we submit color images with our papers for review?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES.</b> Reviewers will get the exact pdf file of
 the paper you submitted, so they can see the color images on the 
screen. Do be warned though that many reviews still like to read printed
 papers and not all have access to high-end color printers. Please make 
sure to comment in the paper to request the reviewers to see the color 
online copy.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">What is ICCV 2015 policy on DUAL SUBMISSIONS?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">Please read the <a href="#dual">dual/double submission paragraph</a> above.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a Technical Report (departmental, arXiv, 
etc.) with publication available online count as a prior publication, and
 therefore is that work ineligible for review and publication at ICCV 2015?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b>  Please read the <a href="#dual">dual/double submission paragraph</a> above.</span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Does a presentation at a departmental seminar during the review period violate the anonymity standard or other ICCV 2015 policy?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>NO.</b> Authors must properly anonymize 
the written submission as per the guidelines. There is no requirement that 
the material otherwise be kept confidential during the review process.</span></li>
</ul>
<br>

<span class="iccvparagraphheader">About the Review Process</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span class="faq_q">Is the ICCV 2015 Review Process CONFIDENTIAL?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a"><b>YES,</b> ICCV 2015 Reviewing is considered 
confidential. All reviewers are required to keep every manuscript they 
review as confidential documents and not to share or distribute 
materials for any reason except to facilitate the reviewing of the 
submitted work. </span></li>
<li><span class="faq_q">Are ICCV 2015 Reviews Double BLIND or Single BLIND?</span><br>
<span class="faq_a">ICCV reviewing is <b>Double BLIND</b>, in that 
authors do not know the names of the area chair/reviewers of their 
papers, and area chairs/reviewers do not know the names of the authors. 
Please read Section 1.6 of the example paper <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamitc.org/iccv15/files/egpaper_for_review.pdf">egpaper_for_review.pdf</a>
 for detailed instructions on how to preserve anonymity. Avoid providing
 information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g.,
 co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., 
titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to 
websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines
 will lead to rejection without review.</span></li>
