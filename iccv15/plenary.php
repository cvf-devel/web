<b>Convex Optimization with Abstract Linear Operators</b></a><br />

<a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stephen P. Boyd</a><br />Stanford University<br />

<p>Domain specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization, such as
CVX and YALMIP and the more recent CVXPY and Convex.jl, are very
widely used to rapidly develop, prototype, and solve convex
optimization problems of modest size, say, tens of thousands of
variables, with linear operators described as sparse matrices.  These
systems allow a user to specify a convex optimization problem in a
very succinct and natural way, and then solve the problem with great
reliability, with no algorithm parameter tuning, and a reasonable
performance loss compared to a custom solver hand designed and tuned
for the problem.  In this talk we describe recent progress toward the
goal of extending these DSLs to handle large-scale problems that
involve linear operators given as abstract operators with fast
transforms, such as those arising in image processing and vision,
medical imaging, and other application areas.  This involves
re-thinking the entire stack, from the high-level DSL design down to
the low level solvers. This is is joint work by Stephen Boyd &amp;
Steven Diamond.</p>

<p><b>Biography:</b></p>

<p>Stephen P. Boyd is the Samsung Professor of Engineering, and
Professor of Electrical Engineering in the Information Systems
Laboratory at Stanford University. He has courtesy appointments in the
Department of Management Science and Engineering and the Department of
Computer Science, and is member of the Institute for Computational and
Mathematical Engineering. His current research focus is on convex
optimization applications in control, signal processing, and circuit
design.</p>

<p>Professor Boyd received an AB degree in Mathematics, summa cum
laude, from Harvard University in 1980, and a PhD in EECS from
U. C. Berkeley in 1985. In 1985 he joined the faculty of Stanford's
Electrical Engineering Department. He has held visiting Professor
positions at Katholieke University (Leuven), McGill University
(Montreal), Ecole Polytechnique Federale (Lausanne), Tsinghua
University (Beijing), Universite Paul Sabatier (Toulouse), Royal
Institute of Technology (Stockholm), Kyoto University, Harbin
Institute of Technology, NYU, MIT, UC Berkeley, and CUHK-Shenzhen. He
holds an honorary doctorate from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH),
Stockholm.</p>

<p>Professor Boyd is the author of many research articles and three
books: Convex Optimization (with Lieven Vandenberghe, 2004), Linear
Matrix Inequalities in System and Control Theory (with L. El Ghaoui,
E. Feron, and V. Balakrishnan, 1994), and Linear Controller Design:
Limits of Performance (with Craig Barratt, 1991). His group has
produced several open source tools, including CVX (with Michael
Grant), a widely used parser-solver for convex optimization.</p>

<p>Professor Boyd has received many awards and honors for his research
in control systems engineering and optimization, including an ONR
Young Investigator Award, a Presidential Young Investigator Award, and
the AACC Donald P. Eckman Award, given annually for the greatest
contribution to the field of control engineering by someone under the
age of 35. In 2013, he received the IEEE Control Systems Award, given
for outstanding contributions to control systems engineering, science,
or technology. In 2012, Michael Grant and he were given the
Mathematical Optimization Society's Beale-Orchard-Hays Award, given
every three years for excellence in computational mathematical
programming. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and SIAM, a Distinguished
Lecturer of the IEEE Control Systems Society, and a member of the
National Academy of Engineering. He has been invited to deliver more
than 75 plenary and keynote lectures at major conferences in control,
optimization, and machine learning.</p>

<p>He currently teaches graduate courses on Linear Dynamical Systems
and Convex Optimization, each attracting around 250 students from many
departments. From 1988 through 2003 he also taught introductory
undergraduate Electrical Engineering courses on Circuits, Signals and
Systems, Digital Signal Processing, and Automatic Control, as well an
advanced course on Nonlinear Feedback Systems. In 1994 he received the
Perrin Award for Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching in the School of
Engineering, and in 1991, an ASSU Graduate Teaching Award. In 2003, he
received the AACC Ragazzini Education award, for contributions to
control education, with citation: "For excellence in classroom
teaching, textbook and monograph preparation, and undergraduate and
graduate mentoring of students in the area of systems, control, and
optimization."</p>

<p>His website, which makes available past papers, books, software,
lecture notes, and selected lecture videos, is visited more than 1.6
million times per year, not counting accesses to iTunes U, YouTube,
Stanford Engineering Everywhere, or MIT Open Course Ware, each of
which include courses developed and delivered by Boyd.</p>

<p>At Stanford he has served as director of the Information Systems
Laboratory (for ten years), chair of the (university wide) Library
Committee, chair of the David Packard EE Building Planning &amp; Design
Committee, and as a member of the (university wide) Advisory Board.</p>
